    Parameters
    ----------
    seed_state : int
        The random number seed to set to all devices.

    Notes
    -----
    The random number generator of MXNet is, by default, device-specific.
    This means that if you set the same seed, the random number sequence
    generated from GPU0 can be different from CPU.
